Welcome to the KPM-nb project.

This project contains a series of Jupyter notebook and Python modules with the aim of creating a series of algorithm useful for extracting linear response properties of various operators.

The project contains the following didacting notebooks:

Lanczos method: here we should find the experiences about the well-knows Haydock recursion method to find matrix elements of the resolvent
* Symmetric (Hermitian) matrices
* Arbitrary Matrices

To be continued
